"Modern marketing, the craft of getting ideas to spread, has split." [says Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2017/05/please-understand.html). 

On the one hand, we have the optimizers. They test and measure, and will try out almost anything, until something causes traffic and engagement to go up. Their core skills are SEO, analytics, A/B tests, and the constantly evolving set of techniques to make algorithms like you on social networks. He calls them the [roboticists](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2017/05/please-understand.html).

On the other, there's the humanists: they value stories, empathy, and taste. They traffic in things that we struggle to measure, like brand voice, tone, and integrity. Most times, they are advocates for what should not be done. (Seth belongs to this second category, and is [developing tools](https://themarketingseminar.com/) for this group). 

These two groups mistrust each other. 

Optimizers think many humanists are at best ineffective, and at worst, lazy charlatans, hiding behind the fact that their work "cannot be measured". Humanists on the other hand, see optimizers as short-term thinkers, missing the big picture, constantly chasing the latest distribution fad, while eroding the trust that exists on the web by stalking and tricking users. 

Both are, to some extent, right. 

But. The reason these two mistrust each other is because this split in marketing has created confusion: the two compete for the same marketing budget, and confused managers will often judge the optimizers' work with humanist metrics, or viceversa. 

These are two different roles, with complimentary functions. In the ferocious battle for attention and resonance that is being waged online, you will need both. Re-align incentives in your company, or hire for what you are missing: you'll see mistrust evaporate, and powerful ideas begin to spread.
