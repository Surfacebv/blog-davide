The founder and CEO of uber-unicorn [Stripe](https://stripe.com) the other day asked the following question on Twitter: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Where do you most often come across interesting ideas—especially weird or surprising ones?</p>&mdash; Patrick Collison (<a href="https://twitter.com/@patrickc">@patrickc</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/967548201615044608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2018</a></blockquote>

I answered with a [short list](https://twitter.com/daveeday/status/967563298773323776) of techniques I use, which seemed to resonate with him and the very smart people who follow him. In fact, I'm mostly writing this blog post in order to let you know that [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand) liked my tweet. 

But I digress. Here are the techniques I use to come across interesting ideas: 

![Philosophy & Boethius](/img/blog/philosophy_consoling_boethius.jpg)

1. **Libraries/bookstores**: the trick here is to stay away from the sections I would usually gravitate towards. I wander through the stacks, pick up a book, or even better a specialized magazine on something I know nothing about (e.g. agricultural biotechnology, Iranian philosophy) and leaf through it randomly until I see something that piques my interest.
2. **Google Images**: often I'll be stuck with abstract concepts I can't quite wrap my head around or want to understand better (e.g. [cryptographic hashes](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1319&bih=718&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=FEWSWve8OML4_AbkmrX4Bw&q=cryptographic+hash), or [mental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model)). Running a Google Image search of that phrase shows you all sorts of visual interpretations of that concept, helping me hit the concept from many different angles. One person also suggests [using different languages](https://twitter.com/adgro/status/968039298334371840) to see different cultural interpretations of the concept. 
3. **Museums**: any stroll around a gallery or museum will help me shake things up, but I find that catalogues of past exhibitions work particularly well. Every single one of them was carefully designed by expert curators to offer new perspectives: for instance, MOMA has granted [access to past exhibition catalogues](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/history?=undefined&page=&direction=fwd), and the [Guggenheim](https://archive.org/details/guggenheimmuseum) also has put some online. 
4. **Twitter / Instagram**: one way to use social media is to follow accounts in your domain of expertise. I try and do the opposite, following accounts that offer me a window into fields, or parts of the world I know very little about. A few good ones: [VR](https://twitter.com/kentbye), [complex systems](https://twitter.com/MelMitchell1), [Francophone Africa](https://twitter.com/jeune_afrique), [Sovereign Wealth Funds,](https://twitter.com/swfinstitute) [renewable energy](https://twitter.com/Sustainable2050), [birds](https://www.instagram.com/gourmetbiologist/).
5. **Brute force**: most ideas I will encounter are already somewhat latent in my brain, in the form of connections between neurons. One way to access those is to sit down with pen and paper and force yourself to write out 10, 20 or 30 ideas: anything goes, and after a while of doing this, I actually manage to get some good ones out.  I stole this method from [James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/) (who is currently doing some [not-so-great stuff](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xe43y/who-the-hell-is-this-crypto-genius), but hey this system works for me).
