Many companies¹ never really find their story. Others try, but settle for a safe, half-baked one.

In these noisy times, half-baked doesn't get you very far. Everywhere you look, people are overloaded with information and with others trying to sell them stuff.

To stand out, you need a focused, powerful story that instinctively resonates with the people you want to engage, whether it's prospective customers, potential hires, or investors. A great company story demonstrates expertise while also generating curiosity, buying you a chance to show more.

Finding this kind of story is really hard work, often harder than telling it, which is a separate process. Depending on the market you operate in, and what market position you want to adopt, it can take months.

But you can save yourself a lot of energy by looking for it in the right place.

Here's a few places where you will not find a great company story. You won't find it in the product or service you are offering. You also won't find it in the founders and the team, however brilliant and interesting you are.²

So where should you look?

Your story resides in the problem you are solving.

Companies exist to solve problems in the marketplace. That is their only purpose.

While they rarely care about your product itself, your audience really cares about the problems they have: most times, they care enough to pay for someone to solve it. If your story embodies the problem you are addressing, and demonstrates you understand its many facets, your audience will care, and listen.

The great thing about problems is that they sit at the juncture where markets, companies and people meet. They are knotty,  and phenomenally rich in insight and important information about the world we live in. A well-defined, fully-understood problem is a gold mine for stories.

So to find your company story, put in the work to understand or re-connect with the many different angles of the problem you are trying to solve. That work, it turns out, will give you an edge in every single aspect of your business.

I mostly work on this with companies, but it could just as easily be a non-profit, a city, a project, a book, or a campaign.*

There are a few exceptions, one of them being if your personal story has made you well known and respected in your industry. \*
