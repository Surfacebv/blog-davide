I turn 35 today.

It feels both early and late in my life. But in the  likely case  I'm mostly just late, here’s a present for myself: a commitment to write, and publish, a blog post every week.

Writing   unscrambles my thinking, energizes me, and helps me make sense of the world. Everyday, I’ll sit down and write about tech, attention, marketing, information flows and how these affect our inner lives.

But most of those words never escape the gravitational pull of my notes app: I’m linked up 

I  don’t publish them.

Here we are, 3.8 Billion people and counting, all linked up in the most incredible network, designed expressly to make words, ideas, and images flow. And I don’t even have a blog: it’s silly.

In his book [The Gift](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Creativity-Artist-Modern-World/dp/0307279502/ref=pd_cp_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=ET7ACV39RPR2Q3H1PYCS), Lewis Hyde says that in order to fulfill its purpose, creative work needs to be let go, to flow and be given away:

> *“whatever we have been given is supposed to be given away again, not kept. Or, if it is kept, something of similar value should move on in its stead…The only essential is this: the gift must always move. There are other forms of property that stand still, that mark a boundary or resist momentum, but the gift keeps going.”*

For many, these clumps of words might be an underwhelming gift, but again, I’m doing this for myself: wherever they end up traveling, that’s not really up to me.

So bon voyage 🎁
