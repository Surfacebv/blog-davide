I turn 35 today.

It feels both early and late in my life. But in the  likely case  I'm mostly just late, here’s a present for myself: a commitment to write, and publish, a blog post every week.

Writing unscrambles my thinking, energizes me, and helps me make sense of the world. I do it almost every day. 

But most of those words never escape the gravitational pull of my notes app. I  don’t publish them. 

Here we are, 3.8 Billion people and counting, all linked up in a network the likes of which the world has never seen, and I don’t even have a blog. It’s silly. 

In his book [The Gift, ](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Creativity-Artist-Modern-World/dp/0307279502/ref=pd_cp_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=ET7ACV39RPR2Q3H1PYCS)Lewis Hyde talks about how creative work needs to flow and be given away, in order to fulfill its purpose:

> *“whatever we have been given is supposed to be given away again, not kept. Or, if it is kept, something of similar value should move on in its stead … The only essential is this: the gift must always move. There are other forms of property that stand still, that mark a boundary or resist momentum, but the gift keeps going.”*

So while I am aware that for many, these clumps of words might be an underwhelming gift, I’m doing this for myself. Wherever it ends up traveling, that’s not up to me. 

So bon voyage 🎁
