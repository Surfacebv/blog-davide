I turn 35 today.

It feels both early and late in my life. But in the very likely case  I'm mostly just late, here’s a present for myself: a commitment to publishing a blog post once a week.

Writing is unambiguously great for me: it cultivates and scrambles my thoughts in pleasant, useful ways. And I've written a lot over the past few years, sometimes regularly, sometimes feverishly, sometimes sloppily: but most of the words I’ve typed out haven’t been able to escape the gravitational pull of my notes app. 

So it’s publishing that makes me uneasy, for several reasons:

* It’s  unclear who I am writing for
* Should I
* I used to write for a living – Journalism has a way of
* believe that it is best to stay silent rather than add to the noise, this
* English or Italian? 
* Blog or Medium? 
* I’m shy
* The incentives of the platforms I will be publishing on are perverse: they encourage you to exploit your friendship for business or ego purposes, turning complex relationships between people into simplyfying

But one thing I've learned over the past 35 is that is this kind of unease needs to be pushed through. Here we are, 3.8 Billion people and counting, all linked up in a network. Not saying something is silly.

And while imposing on you all my glob of ideas might make for a crap gift, it is my birthday, and I’m doing it for myself. Wherever it goes, that’s not up to me. 

So happy birthday.
