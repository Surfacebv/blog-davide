I love working remotely. 

And over the past 7 years, I've been lucky enough to have most of my work happen from different desks in New York, Montreal, Brussels, Paris, or Milan.

That's true for my consulting practice, as well as for [Fleisure](https://weekly.fleisure.com), whose team is fully distributed between New York, Milan, and the small town of Guastalla (pop. 15K) in Italy.

But while working remotely can afford immense benefits to both individuals and organization, it's not easy. For one thing, it does not benefit from the decades of accumulated wisdom and best practices that have grown organically around office work. 

Playbooks for distributed teams have begun to emerge, mostly thanks to modern startups who embraced distributed teams: from [Buffer](https://open.buffer.com/no-office/), to [Doist](https://blog.doist.com/https-blog-doist-com-managing-remote-teams-622521189e80), [Customer.io](https://customer.io/blog/Lessons-from-becoming-a-remote-team.html), [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/blog/building-remote-team), and [Github](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/GitHub-communicating-with-remote-teams/), just to name a few. If you dig around, you'll find [frank & open discussions](https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne/status/938398704746336256) about how to think about remote salaries, and even a [good weekly newsletter](https://remotive.io/community/) dedicated solely to the topic.

I'll add my two cents. In my experience, once a remote setup is in place, teams should try to protect themselves from 3 main risks: 

1. **Communication deficit**: there is a high chance that a communication deficit may build up among the team, with small misunderstandings compounding one another. \
   \
   [One-on-ones](https://a16z.com/2012/08/30/one-on-one/) help, but I believe best way to address this problem is to encourage each person to always over-communicate with each other. Creating an environment in which over-communicating is accepted as a practice to avoid misunderstandings is an antidote to people finding it annoying, pushy or patronizing.     
2. **Big Idea freeze**: ideas just don't flow as easily in your work chat, Github, Skype, Zoom and Google Docs, as when face-to-face. I've noticed that people will focus on communication, problem-solving and execution, and big picture thinking will take a back seat. Even one-on-ones don't allow for too much improvisation, as they usually follow an agenda\
   \
   I do not have great solutions for this yet, and I would love to hear from others:  is asking a lot of big-picture questions on work chat channels.  

3. **Weaker Bonds**: one of the joys of the modern workplace is that humans working together in a pleasant environment tend to naturally build strong, life-long bonds. Working remotely, the chances of this happening are lower: with less face time, bonds don't build up as easily. \
   \
   The solution here, of course, is to meet up as often as possible. Even just a yearly meet-up in a different location has done wonders for our ability to connect with each other on many different levels.
