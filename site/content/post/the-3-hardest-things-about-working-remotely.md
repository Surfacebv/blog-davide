I love working remotely.  

<!--more-->

And over the past 7 years, most of my work has happened remotely. That's true for my consulting practice, as well as for [Fleisure](https://weekly.fleisure.com), whose team is fully distributed between New York, Milan, and the small town of Guastalla (pop. 15K) in Italy.  

It's not easy. Working remotely does not benefit from the decades of accumulated wisdom and best practices that have grown organically around office work.

But playbooks for distributed teams have begun to emerge, mostly thanks to successful, modern startups who embraced remote working: from [Buffer](https://open.buffer.com/no-office/), to [Github](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/GitHub-communicating-with-remote-teams/), to [Doist](https://blog.doist.com/https-blog-doist-com-managing-remote-teams-622521189e80), to [Customer.io](https://customer.io/blog/Lessons-from-becoming-a-remote-team.html) and [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/blog/building-remote-team), just to name a few. If you dig around, you'll find [frank & open discussions](https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne/status/938398704746336256) about how to think about remote salaries, and even a [good weekly newsletter](https://remotive.io/community/) about remote working.  

I'll add my two cents. In my experience, once a remote team is in place, teams should take steps to address 3 main risks: 

1. **Communication deficit**:  remotely, a communication deficit may build up among the team, with small misunderstandings compounding one another. \
   \
   The best way to address this problem is to get into the habit of always over-communicating with your colleagues. Over-communicating is annoying and might be perceived as pushy or patronizing: creating an environment in which it is accepted as a practice to    

2. **Idea freeze**: on Slack, Skype, Zoom and Google Docs, ideas don't flow as easily as at the water cooler. Part of the reason is that

3. **Weaker Bonds**: when humans work together in a welcoming environment, they tend to naturally build strong, life-long bonds. This is one of the joys of work. \

5.   that often naturally emerge between people working in the same physical space for months at a time.\
   \
   The solution here, of course, is to meet up as often as possible.
