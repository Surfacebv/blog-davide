I love working remotely.  

<!--more-->

Over the past 7 years, the vast majority of my work has happened remotely. That's true for my consulting practice, as well as for Fleisure, whose team is fully distributed between New York, Milan, and the small town of [Guastalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guastalla) (pop. 15K) in Italy.

It's not easy. Working remotely does not benefit from the decades of accumulated wisdom and best practices that have grown organically around office work. 

But playbooks have begun to emerge, also thanks to modern startups have embraced remote working: from [Buffer](https://open.buffer.com/no-office/), to [Github](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/GitHub-communicating-with-remote-teams/), to [Customer.io](https://customer.io/blog/Lessons-from-becoming-a-remote-team.html) and [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/blog/building-remote-team), just to name a few.  

I'll add my two cents. In my experience, once a remote team is in place, managers should worry about 3 main risks: 

1. **Communication deficit**: over a communication deficit may build up among the team, with small misunderstandings compounding one another. \
   \
   The best way to address this problem is to get into the habit of always over-communicating with your colleagues. Over-communicating is hard: 
2. **Ideas won't flow as easily**: on Slack, Skype, Zoom and Google Docs, ideas are . Four
   \
   The 
3. **Strong Bonds**: remote work makes it harder for people working together to build the strong, life-long bonds that often naturally emerge between people working in the same physical space for months at a time.\
   \
   The solution here, of course, is to meet up often. Road trips together  help.
