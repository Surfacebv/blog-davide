The web is the biggest microphone in the history of humanity. [3.8 billion](http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/) people and counting, all plugged into a network that is designed to make people talk to each other.

If you truly want this mike, you can probably get your hands on it, whether you are an individual, a company, or a group.

But when it gets handed to you, do you know what you are you going to say?
