The Web is the biggest microphone in the history of humanity. 

<!--more-->

3.8 billion people [and counting](http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/), all plugged into a network that is designed to make people talk to each other.

If you truly want this mike, you can probably get your hands on it, whether you are an individual, a company, a group, or a project.

But when it gets handed to you, do you know what you are you going to say?
